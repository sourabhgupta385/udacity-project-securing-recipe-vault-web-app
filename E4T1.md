### Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

-   **Problem:** Application server is using public-private key based authentication process.
    -   **Solution:** Make use of AWS Systems Manager's Session Manager service to access the application server.
-   **Problem:** Currently security group is designed in such a way that anyone can attempt to login to application server on port 22.
    -   **Solution:** Restrict the IPs that are allowed to communicate to application server by providing CIDR block or exact IP address.

### Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the event that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

-   Use least privileged access model:
    -   Currently instance role policy is set in such a way that all S3 buckets are accessible from the application server. Instead of this, policy should define the specific bucket(Free Recipe) that should be accessible from the application server.
-   Restricting actions in the policy:
    -   Currently instance role policy is set in such a way that all S3 buckets actions are allowed to the role (eg: delete, update). According to use case only read permission are required to get the recipe from the bucket. Thus, actions should be restricted to only what is needed.
-   Advance protection methods:
    -   Enable server side encryption in the S3 bucket.
