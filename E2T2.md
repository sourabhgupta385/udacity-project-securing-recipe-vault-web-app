Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

## Problem

-   CIS 4.1 Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
-   On instance "Web Service Instance - C3", UDP port 20 which is associated with 'FTP' is reachable from the internet
-   On instance "Web Service Instance - C3", UDP port 547 which is associated with 'DHCP' is reachable from the internet

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

## Solution

-   Restrict the IP range that can access the application server on port 22.
-   Security group contains the inbound rule, that allows all trafiic on all port range. That rule should be removed from security group and only needed ports should be opened in the inbound rules of security group.
