#### What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

-   Login to web application instances can be done through AWS Systems Manager. Thus, remove all external access to the instances.

#### Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

-   Using VPC private endpoints alone would not prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket if the IAM permissions are still insecure.

#### Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

-   No, applying default encryption will not encrypt all the existing files. You would need to go back and encrypt all the files that were present prior to enabling encryption.

#### What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

- If those templates are again applied then all the security risks that were identified will again come back in the setup. 
- Thus, all the manual changes done to remediate the security risks should also be changed in cloud formation templates.
